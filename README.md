# Laptop Cooling Performance Analysis

This project evaluates how different laptop cooling configurations
affect CPU/GPU temperatures and benchmark performance.

## Methodology
- Stress test: 3DMark
- Metrics recorded:
  - Peak CPU temperature
  - Performance score
- Test configurations:
  - Laptop on desk
  - Laptop on stand
  - Laptop with active cooling pad

## Results

### Peak CPU Temperature

### 3DMark Performance Score

## Analysis
Active cooling reduced peak CPU temperatures compared to the
baseline desk configuration. Lower temperatures correlated with
higher benchmark scores, showing reduced thermal throttling.

## Data
Raw measurement data is available in the /data directory.
